        <p>You can enter HTML into a note.  This means you can create a
        hyperlink or embed an image.  You can also use javascript event
        handlers.
        </p>
        
        <p>Everytime you press the save button, a snapshot of all your notes
        are saved.  You can load any snapshot by clicking on the circular
        arrow button. <img src='images/reload.gif' alt='reload icon' title='reload icon' />
        </p>
        
        <p>You can quickly change the color of a note by pressing a number
        from 1 to 8 while your mouse is hovering over a note.</p>
        
        <p>You can move a note to the front by clicking on the mini-note.</p>

        <p>You can move all notes of the same color to the front by 
        holding ctrl and clicking on a mini note.</p>
        
        <p>You can filter by color by typing "color:yellow" into the filter
        box. Alternately, you can shift+click on a mini note to filter by
        color</p>
        
        <p>You can resize a note by holding alt and using the left mouse
        button.</p>
        
        <p>You can move all notes of the same color by holding ctrl while
        dragging. (This doesn't work in OS X because the ctrl key
        brings up the right click menu.)</p>
        
        <p>To select text, try holding ctrl+alt while dragging.  Holding the
        windows key may also work if you use Firefox/Mozilla.</p>
        
        <p>The filter box in the upper right corner takes regular
        expressions, not words to search for.</p>
        
        <p>[2004-10-10] Press 'B' to create a note with a
        <a href="http://www.bookmarklets.com/">bookmarklet</a> that
        you can use for quickly creating new notes.</p>

        <p>[2004-08-07] Press 'N' to cycle to the next note and move it to
        the top.  'P' will cycle to the previous note and move it to the
        top.</p>
        
        <p>[2005-05-21] Hold alt and press 'P' to create a new note.  Hold
        alt and press 'S' to save the workspace.  Hold alt and press 'O' to
        start editing a note.  Press Esc while editing a note to stop
        editing.  Use the arrow keys to move a note.</p>
        
        <p>[2004-08-07] You can send a note to the back by holding alt and
        right clicking on the note.</p>

        <p>[2004-08-09] You can access your notes with the shortened URL of
        http://www.aypwip.org/webnote/workspace_name and your rss feed with
        http://www.aypwip.org/webnote/workspace_name.xml.</p>
