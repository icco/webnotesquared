                <blockquote>I test the system in Firefox, Internet Explorer
                5.5 (Windows), Internet Expoer 6.x, Opera 8+, and Safari
                1.3+.</blockquote>

                <span style='font-style: italic;'>Can I use Webnote to store my own notes?</span>
                <blockquote>Sure, use it for anything legal.  I have no
                intentions of charging money in the future or deleting your
                notes.</blockquote>

            <li>
                <span style='font-style: italic;'>How are people using Webnote?</span>
                <blockquote>Some use it to store pictures, others have used it to
                <a href="http://slartibartfast.ultralab.net/~stephenp/blog/archives/001027.html">give presentations</a>.
                It has even been used for real time collaboration (sorry, no link due to server load issues).<br /><br />
                Personally, I just use it to jot down some notes like an electronic TODO list.

            <li>
                <span style='font-style: italic;'>Can I password protect my notes?</span>

                <blockquote>Not right now.  If you want to password protect
                the notes, you could 
                <a href='http://www.aypwip.org/cvs/index.pl/webnote/'>install
                Webnote</a> on your own server and use your favorite
                authentication method (apache .htaccess, ssl, whatever).
                <br /><br />
                
                The main reason for this is that it is difficult to prevent
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSS">cross site
                scripting</a> and allow users to put arbitrary HTML and
                javascript in a note.  I think the flexibility to put
                javascript in notes is more important than being able to
                password protect notes.<br /><br />
                
                Another reason I haven't implemented such a thing is because
                I like the ability of being able to share notes by just
                sharing a URL.

                <span style='font-style: italic;'>Why don't you just use a wiki?</span>
                <blockquote>I use different tools for different types of 
                notes. For me, a wiki is good for collaboration and
                organizing lots of text (with hyperlinks), but bad at
                visually organizing ideas on one screen.
