There are two ways to install.  The command line way (my preferred method)
and using the install.py server script.  If you want to install using
install.py, edit common-default.py to have your database name, username, and
password, rename common-default.py to common.py, upload your files, then
browse to install.py (make sure to chmod the file first).  Just follow the
instructions in your browser.

Alternately, the command line method is described below.

1. Dependencies
  - python 2.3 or newer
  - MySQL (I'm using 4.0.18, but newer version should work as well)
  - MySQLdb-python database module (0.9.2+)
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python
  - pytz python module
    http://pytz.sourceforge.net/
  
2. Create the database tables
  Run the following:
    mysql [db name] < createTables.sql
  This will create two tables, wn_workspaces and wn_notes.

3. Set the database access information
  In the 'etc' directory, there is a file called 'common-default.py'.
  Rename it to common.py and then open it in a text editor.  This file
  contains all the various options for webnote.  You must set the database
  information (DBHOST, DBUSER, DBPASS, DBNAME) and the BASEURL of the site.
  
  There are a lot of other options that you may choose to set.
  
  If you want to log save requests to a file, make sure that apache has
  write access to the log file.

4. Place the files in an executable directory
  Finally, to make the system run, put the files into a directory viewable
  from the web.  Make sure that it can execute python files.  That is,
  make sure all the python files (*.py) are executable (chmod 755 *.py)
  and if it doesn't work, try creating or editing your .htaccess (for the
  Apache web server) file to have:
    AddHandler cgi-script .py
    Options +ExecCGI +Multiviews
  The above will only work if you're allowed to have the above Overrides in
  .your htaccess file.  See the Apache documentation for more information.
  
  I also recently added a gzipped version of webnote.js and if you configure
  apache properly, it should auto automatically send gzipped version if the
  user's browser supports it.  To enable this feature, also add the following
  to your .htaccess file:
    AddEncoding x-gzip gz
  If webnote generates javascript errors about workspace not being defined,
  try deleting webnote.js.gz and objects.js.gs (thus forcing the unzipped
  version to be sent).

5. Admin contact information
  If an error occurs while trying to save a workspace, a popup window
  provides information about emailing the admin for help.  To set the
  email address, open webnote.js and put your email address in place
  of mine.

6. Setup index.html
  Rename index.old.html to index.html for a sample start page.  By default,
  the load button uses ugly URLs (load.py?name=foo).  If you want clean
  URLs, then edit index.html and uncomment the setLocation function.

If it works, I would love to hear about other installations of Webnote.
