The code for webnote is broken up into two files, 
<a href="overview-objects.js.html">objects.js</a> and
<a href="overview-webnote.js.html">webnote.js</a>.  objects.js contains
generic classes like a <a href="Point.html">Point</a> class and a 
<a href="Color.html">Color</a> class while webnote.js contains the 
Webnote specific classes.  For the most part, the javascript for Webnote
is written in an object oriented way.</p>

<p>
The classes are organized like so:
<pre>
<a href="Workspace.html">Workspace</a>
  |
  +- "dictionary" of <a href="Note.html">Note</a> objects
  |
  +- <a href="History.html">History</a> object
  |
  +- <a href="Mouse.html">Mouse</a> object
</pre>
</p>

<p>
There is a single global Workspace called workspace that can be used to
access any of the other objects and methods.  The class also contains methods
for global actions such as <a href="Workspace.html#filter">filtering the
notes</a>, <a href="Workspace.html#save">saving the workspace</a>, or
<a href="Workspace.html#createNote">creating new notes</a>.
</p>

<p>
Each note contains two parts: the HTML that makes up the note and a <a
href="Note.html">Note</a> object in memory.  Most changes to the HTML can be
done via the wrapper methods provided in the Note class.  For example,
note1.<a href="Note.html#setText">setText</a>("hello world") would set the
text of note1.
</p>

<p>
<a href="History.html">History</a> is used to maintain the undo and redo
stack.  The <a href="History.html#add">add</a> method is used to add an event
to the undo stack.
</p>

<p>
<a href="Mouse.html">Mouse</a> is used to handle events that span time.  For
example, <a href="SelectedObjectDrag.html">dragging a note</a> or 
<a href="SelectedObjectResize.html">resizing a note</a> are operations that
use Mouse.
